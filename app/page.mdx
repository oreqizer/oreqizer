## About

Software engineer with 9+ years of experience in the travel industry
([Kiwi.com](https://www.kiwi.com)) and marketplaces ([GainWagon](https://gainwagon.com) and
[Seasy](https://seasy.at)). I am passionate about _web apps_, _CI/CD_, _AI_ and want to learn
_iOS development_. I greatly value educating others, sometimes contribute to open source
projects, enjoy talking at tech conferences and occasionally writing articles. Master's degree in
**Management of software systems and services**, my diploma was about **AB testing**.

## Values

My entire career revolves around finding **simple solutions to complex problems**. I believe that
any business requirement can be delivered _while_ improving maintainability and performance. Quality
goes hand in hand with speed and my workflow reflects that. I am a strong advocate of **CI/CD** and
iterative development.

You can expect me to be brutally honest, transparent and to the point â€” I want the same from you. I
want raw, uncensored feedback so that I can continually improve. I work to deliver value to the
business and to the users. No redundant ceremonies, lengthy meetings or useless politics.
