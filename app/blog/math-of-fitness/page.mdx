<Cover title="The Math of Fitness" />

"Fitness" is one of the most bastardized terms in the industry. No one really knows what does the
word mean. Some interpret it as low-enough body fat. Others consider people with great endurance to
be fit, such as marathon runners. Strength and muscle is often an indicator of fitness as well.
The list goes on.

I am going to offer a mathematical interpretation of fitness, along with practical implications that
arise in context of life and sport performance. These ideas are not new. Greg Glassman, the founder
of CrossFit, has talked about this interpretation multiple times during
[his presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl6ANK8CN5w). I want to build upon his ideas
and introduce a robust training framework for optimizing life.

# Definition

If you search for the term "fitness", you get a bunch of definitions:

The first definition, "the condition of being physically fit and healthy" is ambiguous â€” how should
one interpret "fit"? Most people will give completely different answers, and most of these people
will be wrong.

The second definition, "the quality of being suitable to fulfil a particular role or task" is more
interesting. Applying it on the prior definition, we can define "fit" as "being physically able to
function in life".

This means that a person can list tasks they want to be able to perform, then gauge their fitness
based on their performance executing said tasks. For example, one may want to:

- do some household stuff like organize items, carry suitcases to the car
- play with their kids, toss them around, participate in outside games
- do leisure sports such as snowboarding, hiking, bowling
- do intellectual activities for relaxation

For this person, fitness means being able to perform these actions with ease, ideally into a very
old age. They want to be productive at their job, lead an active lifestyle with family and friends
and still have some energy left for books and video games in the evening.
