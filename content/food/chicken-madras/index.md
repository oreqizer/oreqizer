This is my **chicken madras** recipe, simplified for my meal prep needs.

# Ingredients

- 4 larger onions, roughly chopped
- 3 larger garlic cloves
- thumb-sized peeled ginger
- 6 tbsp ghee / vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp madras curry powder
- 2 tbsp garam masala powder
- 2 tbsp red chilli powder / paprika
- 3 tbsp table salt
- 4-6 large cayenne chillies
- 1/2 cup white wine vinegar
- 800g canned tomatoes
- 280g tomato puree
- 400ml coconut milk
- 1.5-2kg chicken breasts

# Process

Heat up the _fat_ in a deep frying pan. Fry the _onions_ until softened. Add in
the chicken, fry until white on the outside. When done, move into a big pot.

Mix the _garlic_, _ginger_, _chillies_, _spices_, _salt_, _vinegar_, _tomatoes_
and _puree_ in a food processor, blend until smooth. Cover the chicken and
onions with the blend. Mix in the _coconut milk_.

Simmer for 40min, or slow-cook on low for 6 hours.

# Serving

Serve with basmati rice or naan, garnish with coriander if you're Mr.
Fancypants.
